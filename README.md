# Desktop-Crab-Shimeji-
This adorable crab drawn by me will walk around your desktop with cute animations, 
pressing H will have a simple heart appear from above the crab. It can also be picked up and dragged using mouse button.
Includes walking left and right animations, idle blinking animation, heart animation.

Everytime you open the application, the crab's size is randomized.

Download the project from the directory and run the DesktopCrab.exe

Art and code by me, the whole project is inspired by the concept of desktop shimejis, which are small characters that interact with the desktop environment.
